So, I forgot to use the ctrl + enter to save the code in VSCode, that is why I can not push the updates in my files

Now I am updating this and that, learning to pull things and to push.

So for a new Repo I need to:
1. git init in my folder
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "mesage"
4. git remote add origin "ssh copy code" (after being created the ssh key)
5. git branch -M main
6. git push -u main
7. git pull
